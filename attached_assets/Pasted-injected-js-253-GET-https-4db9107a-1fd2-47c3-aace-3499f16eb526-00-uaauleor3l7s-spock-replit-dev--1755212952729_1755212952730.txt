A more reliable and productive Chrome DevTools
In Chrome 139, DevTools prioritized product excellence and developer experience. We tackled numerous known issues, including some years-old ones, and also made improvements to newer features. Behind the scenes, we enhanced our test coverage and migrated tests to more robust foundations.

We hope you will experience these numerous subtle fixes across various panels, making your daily debugging and development workflows smoother, more reliable, and more productive.

Upload images in AI assistance for styling
To provide additional visual context to your prompts, you can now upload arbitrary images in the AI assistance panel when you start your conversation from the Elements panel with a DOM element selected as context.
