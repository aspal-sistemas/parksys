# ParkSys - Parks Management System

## Overview
ParkSys is a comprehensive municipal parks management system designed to streamline the management of parks, activities, volunteers, instructors, assets, and finances.

The vision is to provide municipalities with a robust tool to efficiently manage urban green spaces, enhance citizen engagement, and ensure sustainable park operations.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application uses a client-server architecture with a modern full-stack:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (shadcn/ui), React Query for state management, React Router for navigation, and React Hook Form with Zod for forms.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript, and Multer for file uploads (local storage).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control system.

## Recent Changes (August 1, 2025)
- **NEW: 10-Tier Gemstone & Precious Metal Sponsor System**: Completely redesigned sponsorship categories:
  - **Replaced 4-tier system** (Bronce, Plata, Oro, Platino) with **10-tier gemstone/precious metal system**
  - **New Tiers**: Amatista ($25k), Esmeralda ($50k), Zafiro ($75k), Ã“nix ($125k), Cobre ($200k), Bronce ($300k), Plata ($450k), Oro ($650k), Platino ($900k), Diamante ($1.2M)
  - **Each tier includes**: Unique gemstone/metal emoji icon, tier-specific color scheme, graduated benefits package, descriptive status titles
  - **UI Enhancements**: Dynamic tier selection with pricing, visual icons in all cards and forms, enhanced package displays
- **Database Schema Updates**: Restructured sponsorship system tables:
  - Updated `category` field values in `sponsorship_packages` and `package_category` in `sponsors` tables to use new gemstone/precious metal names
  - Inserted comprehensive benefit packages for each of the 10 new tiers with elegant gemstone-inspired naming
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing sponsor data structure
- **UI Consistency**: Standardized sponsor management modal interactions and button text to "Guardar cambios"
- **Form Validation**: Updated Zod schemas to match new database structure
- **Component Architecture**: Separated logo upload states between create/edit modals to prevent interference
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Emphasizes a consistent design language with `Card` patterns, standardized iconography (e.g., `bg-gray-50`, `w-8 h-8 text-gray-900`, `text-3xl font-bold`), corporate color palettes (e.g., green, blue, orange, purple, teal), and responsive layouts. Design principles include visual-first approaches (e.g., photo-prominent cards), intuitive navigation (e.g., left-aligned admin navigation, simplified sidebars), and clear separation of content.
- **Technical Implementations**: Features include dynamic form handling, robust data validation, lazy loading for routes, centralized state management, and optimized image loading.
- **Feature Specifications**:
    - **Park Management**: Comprehensive CRUD for parks, amenities, multimedia (images, documents), and integration with other modules.
    - **Activity Management**: Creation, scheduling, categorization, image management, instructor assignment, and public catalog.
    - **Visitor Management**: Daily and range-based visitor counting, demographic breakdown, and statistical reporting.

    - **Event Management**: General events and specific AMBU (Agencia Metropolitana de Bosques Urbanos) events with differentiated forms and cost calculators.
    - **Space Reservations**: Management of reservable spaces with automatic cost calculation and calendar views.
- **System Design Choices**: Single Source of Truth architecture ensures data consistency across modules. Internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages (Spanish, English, Portuguese) is implemented throughout the application. Error handling is robust with detailed logging and user-friendly notifications. Optimized for Replit deployment.
