# ParkSys - Parks Management System

## Overview
ParkSys is a comprehensive municipal parks management system designed to streamline the management of parks, activities, volunteers, instructors, assets, and finances. It offers a modern full-stack application with role-based access control and various modules to support diverse park operations. The vision is to provide municipalities with a robust tool to efficiently manage urban green spaces, enhance citizen engagement, and ensure sustainable park operations.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application uses a client-server architecture with a modern full-stack.
**UI/UX Decisions**: Emphasizes a consistent design language with `Card` patterns, standardized iconography, corporate color palettes (e.g., green, blue, orange, purple, teal), and responsive layouts. Design principles include visual-first approaches, intuitive navigation, and clear separation of content.
**Technical Implementations**: Features include dynamic form handling, robust data validation, lazy loading for routes, centralized state management, and optimized image loading.
**Feature Specifications**:
- **Park Management**: Comprehensive CRUD for parks, amenities, and multimedia. Includes park statistics with 9 indicator cards, and a streamlined interface with search-only filters.
- **Activity Management**: Creation, scheduling, categorization, image management, instructor assignment, and public catalog.
- **Visitor Management**: Daily and range-based visitor counting, demographic breakdown, and statistical reporting.
- **HR Management**: Employee directory, payroll processing, vacation requests, departmental organization with organigrams, and CSV import/export.
- **Financial Management**: Accounting (SAT codes, journal entries, cash flow matrix), expense/income categories, and budget planning.
- **Asset Management**: Inventory tracking, maintenance scheduling, incident reporting, and asset assignments.
- **Communication & Marketing**: Email campaigns, templates, bulk sending, analytics, and dynamic advertising spaces with impression/click tracking.
- **Volunteer & Instructor Management**: Registration, evaluation, recognition, and profile management with email-based invitation system for instructors.
- **Concession Management**: Contracts, active concessions, financial integration, and detailed public pages.
- **Security**: Advanced authentication, login attempt tracking, audit logs, and password recovery, including a comprehensive role-based access control system with 7 hierarchical roles and granular permissions.
- **Tree Management**: Inventory, species catalog, maintenance tracking, and ecological data.
- **Event Management**: General events and specific AMBU events with differentiated forms and cost calculators.
- **Space Reservations**: Management of reservable spaces with automatic cost calculation and calendar views.
- **Sponsor Management**: Supports a 10-tier gemstone/precious metal sponsorship system with unique icons, color schemes, and graduated benefits.
- **Configuration & Security Maintenance**: Centralized modules for backup, performance monitoring, and system updates.
**System Design Choices**: Single Source of Truth architecture ensures data consistency across modules. Clear separation between organizational users (with login access) and external catalogs (employees, volunteers, instructors, concessionaires as independent databases). Email-based invitation system for instructor registration with token validation and expiration. Internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages (Spanish, English, Portuguese) is implemented throughout the application. Error handling is robust with detailed logging and user-friendly notifications. Optimized for Replit deployment. All images are handled via a local multer-based file upload system with dynamic detection for production/development environments and a build-time asset migration script for Vercel deployments. Server health checks are optimized for rapid response and robust detection across various deployment platforms. The Admin UI has been standardized with consistent layouts and all sidebar modules have been integrated into the main content flow for improved accessibility and visual coherence.

**Recent Updates (January 2025)**: Park view interface has been restructured with 6 core tabs: Informaci√≥n, Actividades, Concesiones, Reservas, Eventos, and Incidencias. Removed Trees and Assets tabs, replaced with new operational modules. All new tabs display real database data with detailed information cards. Concessions show full operational details including payments and schedules. Reservations display contact information, costs, and booking details. Events system adapted to work with location-based searching instead of direct park relationships. Dashboard indicator cards updated to reflect new tab structure with proper data connectivity.
